This directory contains ZX Spectrum Next palette files in four common palette
formats. The palette files are available in 256 (8-bit) colours and, if
supported by the palette format, 512 (9-bit) colours.

The order of the colours in the palette files are in ascending RGB order. This
is fine for image conversion needs. However, if you are a graphics artist you
may want to edit the palettes in order to group related colours according to
your needs, e.g. having all the grey colours together etc.

Palette files for the following palette formats are provided:

* .act (Adobe Photoshop)
* .gpl (GIMP)
* .pal (JASC PaintShop Pro)
* .txt (Paint.NET)

If you are using another paint program than one from the list above, it is
possible that it will still support one or more of the palette formats above.

Note 1: The .act palette format only supports 256 colours.

Note 2: Paint.NET will only read the first 96 colours of a .txt palette file.
So the palette files must be split up to your discretion.
